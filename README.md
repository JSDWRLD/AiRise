   - Pull requests are subject to review to ensure that the main branch does not break.
3. **Code Reviews**: Ensure at least 2 reviewers approve before merging. Ping the Discord server with `@everyone` to notify the team.
4. **Commit Messages**: Use clear, concise commit messages in the format: `type: message`.
5. **No Large PRs**: Keep pull requests small and focused on a single task to make the review process easier.
6. **No Sensitive Data**: Never commit passwords, API keys, or any sensitive information to the repository.
7. **Documentation**: Update documentation whenever making changes to the code or features.
8. **IMPORTANT - Rebasing**: Rebase your branch on `main` before submitting a pull request to ensure your changes are up-to-date and conflict-free.
